<p> <font color="#D291BC"> Ma, Words will never be enough to express how grateful i am for everything you've done for us. You are the strongest and most inspiring woman i know. Life may not have been easy for you but you've always shown unwavering  courage and resilience. Raising us on your own after Tatay passed away must have been incredibly dificult, but you never once let us feel the weight of struggle. instead, you poured your heart and soul ito making sure we had everything, not just physically but emotionally and spiritually as well.<br> You tought us the value of respect,kindness and faith in God, and you've been the guiding light that kept us on a right path. You've worked so hard to give us a better life, even though you are sick, you manage to get up and go to work. and i will forever be in awe of your strength,independence and love. Ma, you've more than a mother to me, your my hero, source of strength and my greatest model. I hope that one day i can make you as proud as you've made me. Thankyou for every sacrifice, every moment of Love, and every word of encouragement. Ilove you more than word can say. <br>
<br> 
 
To my Tatay, even though you've been gone since 2017, you remain deeply alive in my heart. you we're the Kind father every child dreams o. loving, selfless, and always present when we needed you. The memories we shared, no matter how simple, are treasures i hold close. you showed me what it means to be a good person, and your example continous to guide me even though you're no longer here. <br> There's not a day that goes by that i dont Miss You , i miss your wisdom, your laugh, and the way you made our family feel safe and whole. it breaks my heart that you're not longer here with us, but i know you,re watching over us from above. Thankyou for loving us unconditionally and for being the father we will always be proud of. I promise to keep your memory alive by living a life that honors the lesson you thought me. Thankyou for giving us the kind of love that never fades, even with time.
